## Hi There
I'm turning my Github into a digital garden.:seedling::potted_plant:  I'd like to store and share the projects I do. 
I can't share any of the stuff I do for work usually, so most of what's here is learning, trial projects or fun stuff.

## Stuff I Use 

| Purpose              | Technology                                                                               | Considering Replacement with                                                     | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JS Framework         | [React](https://reactjs.org/)                                                            |                                                                                  | I know it, its popular and the alternatives value add isn't high enough to offset the cost.                                                                                                                        |
| State Management     | hooks / context api                                                                      | [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)                                   | I've always considered Redux too much / complicated, but RTK's slices have made me start to reconsider.                                                                                                            |  
| Style                | [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)                                                           | [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)                                             | I've been using Sass for years, but only for a short list of its features. I'm thinking about switching over to Tailwind for the utility based savings, plus it lines up better with component based architecture. |
| Language             | [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)                                            |                                                                                  | I'm a reluctant TS user. Its a huge pain, but the bugs it caches make it worth it. Probably.                                                                                                                       |
| Unit testing         | [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) / enzyme                                                      | [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) | I've used Jest and enzyme forever, and I know testing-library is supposed to be better. Currently charging motivation to try it.                                                                                   |
| Build tool           | [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)                                                       | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)                                                      | Vite is so fast, but can it do weird stuff as well as webpack?                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3D | [react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) |                                                                                  | Helps integrate three stuff into a react app more naturally.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Design               | [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)                                                          |                                                                                  | I like it cause its cross-platform and it's auto layout concept lines up with building stuff with flexbox, which helps tie design and code together a little.                                                      |
